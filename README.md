# About The Research


Sentiment analysis is a recent and extensive topic of research in voice processing. To improve the outcome and quality of the output, this study seeks to identify new techniques or better ways to apply those that already exist. the speech database’s location is one of the difficulties encountered when working. A review of the literature on several techniques for analyzing human speech is reviewed. This study introduces the fuzzy logic method, which can be used to analyze text sentiment more precisely. Tensorflow-enabled neural networks have been used to immediately recognise sentiment in speech data.

> What is NLP ?
Natural language processing is referred to the abilities of a machine or computer software to comprehend spoken and written human language

# Text Sentiment Analysis
**For sentiment analysis in our study, we applied a fuzzy rule base technique. Fuzzy logic-based systems can handle ambiguity and indefiniteness.**

1. Fuzzification: Processing of crisp input into fuzzy input in form of membership function.
2. Evaluation of rule: Stages of use of rules which determine what control actions to perform in response to the inputs.
3. Aggregation: Aggregation of rule outputs
4. Defuzzification: The process of converting the fuzzy conclusions into detailed output values **

## Speech Sentiment Analysis

1. Data Visualisation: the display of data using common images, including infographics, charts, and even animations.
2. Data Preparation: transforming raw data into something that can be processed and analyzed further.
3. Feature Extraction:  the process of converting raw data into processable numerical features while keeping the original data set's content intact.
4. Sentiment Classification:  the methodology of automatically identifying written opinions and classifying them as either good, negative, or neutral depending on the feelings that users express.



## Conclusion and Future Scope 

The proposed plan of action presents an approach to recognizing the sentiments of human speech. Through this project, we have shown how we can maximize the advantage of the machine learning model and build a fuzzy logic approach.
This infers that the defuzzification output of our signal files differs from the output of the NN technique which creates inconsistency between the text and speech sentiments hence we have found the Inconsistency between the results of text sentiment scores and speech sentiment scores. i.e., Positive, Neutral, and negative.
